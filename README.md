This a small installer for running programs with privilege elevation (under UAC)
=====================================

I run Windows 2008 R2 in production, and I use notepad++.

For some files, I need to jump through hoops (i.e. navigate through the file menu of notepad++ which is annoying)

I stole some files from http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2008.06.elevation.aspx

And modified some of those to add a context menu that allows me to open a file with notepad++ as administrator.

This assumes you installed notepad++ in D:\tools\Notepad++\

Feel free to use it and modify it to adjust to your environment.

99.999% of the credit goes to Michael Murgolo the author of the elevation program.
